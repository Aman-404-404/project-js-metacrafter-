START

This Solidity contract demonstrates the minting and burning of a simple token, serving as an introductory example for new Solidity developers. It maintains a balance mapping while enabling the creation and destruction of tokens.


DESCRIPTION
The contract resembles an ERC-20 token, featuring functions to mint and burn tokens, which update balances accordingly. It includes public variables for the token's name, symbol, and total supply. The constructor initializes the token's details, and condition checks ensure proper balance management.
